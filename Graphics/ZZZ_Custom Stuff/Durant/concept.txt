This Durant is Grass/Bug. It's based on the ant species called Cephalotes varians.
Staconan Durant use their abdomens to shield themselves against attacks. In the wild, their broad abdomens are used as 'doorstops'
to prevent intruders from getting into their nest. They plug it in holes to prevent invasion.

The regular colour scheme is based on leaves/logs. The shiny is based on Birch trees.
